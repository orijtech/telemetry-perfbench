Performance benchmarks comparing various telemetry projects.

This repository exists to provide benchmarks of popular logging libraries to compare against logging using the API in `x/tools/internal/telemetry`.

## Running the benchmarks

Follow the instructions [here](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/212078) to get results for no logging, std logging, and `internal/telemetry` logging, then run them in the root directory of this repository to get results for popular loggers.
